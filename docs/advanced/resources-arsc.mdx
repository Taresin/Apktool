Within an Android application lies a `resources.arsc`, which is a binary file containing resources of the application.
The `.arsc` extension hints at Android Resource Storage Container which is a massive collection of chunks.

If we dumped the first line of the file, we would see the following:

```
0200 0c00 f00b 0000 0100 0000 0100 1c00  ................
```

The `.arsc` file uses what is described as a `ResChunk_header` to describe the chunks within the file. This header is
what starts of the file off and is as follows:

#### ResChunk_header

| Name        | Size    | Description            |
|-------------|---------|------------------------|
| Type        | 2 bytes | The type of the chunk  |
| Header Size | 2 bytes | The size of the header |
| Size        | 4 bytes | The size of the chunk  |

So knowing we have a little endian structure we can parse out this header. We get:

 * Type - `0x0002`
 * Header Size - `0x000c`
 * Size - `0x00000bf0`

So we can leverage the [ResourceTypes.h](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/libs/androidfw/include/androidfw/ResourceTypes.h)
file in order to understand what this chunk is.

```cpp
enum {
    RES_NULL_TYPE                     = 0x0000,
    RES_STRING_POOL_TYPE              = 0x0001,
    RES_TABLE_TYPE                    = 0x0002,
    RES_XML_TYPE                      = 0x0003,
};
```

So we start the file with a `RES_TABLE_TYPE` chunk. This chunk is described as:

#### ResTable_header
| Name          | Size    | Description            |
|---------------|---------|------------------------|
| Header        | 8 bytes | The type of the chunk  |
| Package Count | 4 bytes | The number of packages |
